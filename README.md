Ruby on Rails Workshop Shell App
----

This is a blank app for getting started in a Ruby on Rails workshop weekend course.

It includes bootstrap-sass, devise, haml, and simple_form. The only functionality is sign in, sign out, sign up, and flash messages.

It's intended use is as a stepping stone to the more interesting parts of rails when teaching.
